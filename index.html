    <li>Response by the legendary Uwe Petersen</li>
  <li>Dear Eric, many thanks for sending me your paper. There are a few things I would like to say.</li>
  
  <li>Since you focus exclusively on the historical-philosophical background materials I want to point out that this is a collection of materials that is in no way intended to provide a narrative, in particular not an attempt to lead to a specific logic.</li>
  
  <li>As I said in the introductory comments: "My aim was to compile -- the silly and the sublime ... " .</li>
  
  <li>I do quote from my 1980 (in translation) on the last page (p. 1368, quotation 99.11 (2)) of Book Two which is as far as I go in these materials.</li>
  
  <li>I started compiling these materials in 1984, after I had found what constitutes (pretty much) "the final form of the sought for logic" :Gentzen's LK (or LJ) minus contraction.</li>
  
  <li>This is characterized by allowing unrestricted abstraction consistently.</li>
  
  <li>It has been published (in German) in 1980 with a cut elimination proof in the presence of unrestricted abstraction.</li>
  
  <li>To the best of my knowledge, this logic (with a cut elimination proof) has been first presented in Grishin's 1974 (in Russian, full reference in the SL paper) of which I only learned in 1985.</li>
  
  <li>A sketch of this development can be found in my 2000 Studia Logica paper (pdf attached).</li>
  
  <li>Category theory doesn't come with an explicitly formalized logic which I take to constitute a significant methodological difference.</li>
  
  <li>A connection to category theory can well come via Church's untyped lambda-calculus, resp. Curry's combinatory logic.</li>
  
  <li>In this respect: there are the following two quotations:
    <ul>
      <li>Haskell Curry may be surprised to hear that he had spent a lifetime doing fundamental work in category theory. The purpose of this account is to convince categorists that Cartesian closed categories (Eilenberg and Kelly, 1966) have been anticipated by logicians (Curry, 1930) by many years and, conversely, to persuade logicians that combinatory logic may benefit from being phrased in categorical language. (Lambek [1980], p. 377)</li>
      <li>lambda-calculus or combinatory logic is a topic that logicians have studied since 1924. Cartesian closed categories are more recent in origin, having been invented by Lawvere [1964]. Both are attempts to describe axiomatically the process of substitution, so it is not surprising to ?nd that these two subjects are essentially the same. (Lambek and Scott [1999], p. 41)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>I take the contradictions of dialectic to be of the form of a mutual dependency of the form A <--> not A which is provided by unrestricted abstrzction.</li>
  
  <li>This is very different to paraconsistent logic and/or dialetheism which considers contradictions of the form A & not A.</li>
  
  <li>The main point of my approach is that unrestricted abstraction can be consistently dealt with in the absence of contraction.</li>
  
  <li>The difference between Priest's "Logic of Paradox" and my approach is that Priest's LP amounts to Gentzen's LK without cut, and my LD is defined as LK without contraction.</li>
  
  <li>Logic without cut still leads to factually wrong results.</li>
  
  <li>I attach a recent paper of mine from the APAL which deals with that, but without mentioning dialetheism (just to remain on the safe side of logic).</li>
  
  <li>I also attach a recent paper from the Archive for Mathematical Logic which pushes induction a bit further in contraction free logic (from the SL paper) to include nested double induction.</li>
  
  <li>Best wishes,<br>Uwe</li>
</ul>
